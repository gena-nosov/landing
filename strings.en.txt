PROGREV1='In 1993, the world saw Doom, the creation of id Software.'
PROGREV2='A little later, in 1996, three schoolboys from the Moscow region - Alexey Volynskov, Vladimir Kalinin, and Evgeny Kovtunov - created Doom2D. A parody that turned into a legend.'
PROGREV3='Doom2D could not boast a 3D engine. However, it ran noticeably faster than its famous namesake, and it could be played by two players cooperatively or against each other on a single 386 computer, common for residents of the former USSR. Additionally, the game came with a convenient map editor that allowed anyone to create their own levels.'
PROGREV4='In 2004, rs.falcon and DEAD ported Doom2D to Windows, releasing Doom2D Forever. A community emerged, the era changed, and today Doom2D Forever runs on most PCs and Android devices - featuring intense online multiplayer, improved graphics, hundreds of levels to play, and many enhancements.'
PROGREV5='The game is open source and written in FPC Delphi.'
